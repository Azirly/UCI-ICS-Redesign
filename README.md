# UCI-ICS-Redesign

**Team: Event Horizon**

<br> **Curent Goal**
<br>Team Event Horizon is working with sponsor Matt Miller and the ICS Website Taskforce Committee to redesign the ICS departmental website. Currently the website is not scalable for all types of devices, and it is organized in such a way that the screen is overwhelmingly crowded and composed mostly of text and nested pages, making it complicated to navigate. Thus, our goal is to create a new design so that the website is updated, responsive, easy to navigate, and easy to maintain.

At the beginning of the quarter, Team Event Horizon had an initial meeting to discuss individual differences and similarities, strengths and weaknesses, as well as prepare questions to ask Matt. At the first meeting with Matt and the ICS Website Taskforce Committee, we were able to discuss expectations regarding deliverables, requirements, and resources. We met again to discuss design ideas and decided to closely refer to the University of Texas at Austin Computer Science Department website since that is what the dean of the ICS department saw as an ideal design. Our third meeting with Matt was to confirm requirements and personas, which we based our user stories on. Our team has individually produced rough sketches of design ideas for the layout of the website, and as of Friday, October 13 Matt was able to grant us access to WordPress as a sandbox to experiment with.

During the middle of the quarter, Team Event Horizon created individual visual mock-ups of their respective rough sketches which were then presented to Matt and sent out to the ICS Website Taskforce Committee. With a wide range of feedback we have iterated through another round of detailed sketches. We have collectively come up with a visual mock up of the new sketch to present to Matt and the rest of the ICS Website Taskforce Committee. Once we agree on and confirm a final design we will be able to discuss specific features we would like to implement regarding the styling of the website.

We have also created storyboards to show the interaction and experience flow of the design. This will help ensure that the website is easily navigable for all users. To further produce a better understanding of our design, we have created various UML diagrams regarding different uses of the website as well as what features are included in the website. Thus far we have created four different diagrams: a sequence diagram and a corresponding class diagram demonstrating how an undergraduate would look up the ICS Academic Year Plan, a UML class diagram summarizing all of the features and requirements integrated in our design, and a state diagram showing the main navigation within the website.

In the near future, we will learn and begin to create our own custom theme in WordPress, implementing our final design. This will allow us to produce a live and working prototype of the redesigned website and thus help Matt and the ICS Website Taskforce Committee to better visualize and make sense of our design. 

Based on our meetings and progress thus far, the main deliverables expected from Team Event Horizon include rough sketches of the initial design, mock-ups of the homepage as well as content pages, and a WordPress prototype of at least the home page. In order to achieve these goals we have completed our own individual rough sketches as well as visual mock-ups of our own designs. We met with Matt and the ICS Website Taskforce Committee to discuss the pros and cons of each design. With feedback, we aim to create and agree on a final design by the end of Week 6. Then we aim to generate high fidelity mock-ups by the end of Week 7, iterate and obtain approval by the end of Week 8, and construct the WordPress prototype by the end of Week 9. Last minute changes and final touches will be implemented by the end of Week 10.
